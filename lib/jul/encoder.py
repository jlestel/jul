"""Encoders (BERT, XLM-R, e5...) as backbones: the micro models of jul.

A decoder is read at the last token of a prompt that ends on the answer. An encoder has no such
token: every position sees the whole text, and a sentence embedding model is trained so that the
mean of its last layer over the text is the text's meaning. So an encoder is read as it was trained:
the features of a layer are [mean over every token of the sequence ; mean over the input's tokens],
and the vector method keeps the first half, as it keeps the last token of a decoder. The option
vectors are the embeddings of the options, the state's is the embedding of the state: zero-shot is
plain embedding similarity, and a tuned head (`autotune`, lexical or hybrid) does the rest.

What changes against a decoder:
- the tokens are wrapped in the tokenizer's special tokens ([CLS] ... [SEP], <s> ... </s>), and a
  batch is padded with an attention mask (attention is bidirectional);
- nothing can be cached: a prefix changes every position after it and is changed by them. The
  prefix of a prompt is therefore run again with each query. Encoder prompts are a few tokens.
- a sequence is capped at the model's positions (512 for BERT-like models);
- the prompts (see `templates`): no chat template, no "in one word" cue; the model's own input
  convention (e5: "query: ") is prepended.

On e5-small (21M parameters outside the embedding), a head over these vectors and TF-IDF scored
0.784 on dair-ai/emotion and 0.890 on Banking77, against 0.797 and 0.900 for Harrier 0.6B (440M),
in 4 ms against 55 ms per value on one CPU thread (jul-lambda, 2026-09-25).
