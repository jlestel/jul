JuL is a Python library that answers typed questions about a piece of text: pick an option
(`Choice`), say yes or no (`Noul`), give a score (`Score`). Each answer comes with a probability. It
has the same API as the SDK of Jev, TypeSafe's hosted decision model.

The model is stopped one step before its first syllable and the answer is read straight out of its
hidden states: no monologue, no reasoning trace, no opinion on the matter. It has nothing to say, and
it says it in 55 milliseconds.

It runs on your own machines, from a Mac to a Linux server, so you can keep it running 24/7 on your own
infrastructure. Your text never goes to a third party and there is no per-call bill. The model weights
are downloaded once from the Hugging Face Hub, or loaded from a local path; after that it runs with no
network at all.

## Why JuL

- Zero-shot: the default model scores 0.857 on Jev's public benchmark (Jev: 0.753) without one example
  of its tasks. Its settings were fitted on dev sets the benchmark never touches. On AG News, the one
  task embedding models haven't trained on, the default gets 0.90, `wemm-4b` 0.95 and Jev 0.91.
- Many options: option vectors are computed once and cached, so adding options barely changes the cost
  of a call. On Banking77's 72 intents the default model gets 0.87, on a task its training data
  (MTEB) contains.
- Probabilities you can use: ECE 0.084, so you can automate above a confidence threshold and send the
  rest to a human.
- Small and fast: 2.6 GB and 55 ms per decision on a Mac. `f2llm-1.7b` (converted
  locally, not published yet) fits in 1 GB and answers in 24 ms.
- Replaceable model: we measured 18, and `jul models add` wires in a new one without touching your code.
- Tunable when you have labels: `autotune(...)` takes the default model from 0.857 to 0.897 with 1000
  examples, and keeps the head only if it beats zero-shot.
- Drop-in for the Jev SDK: change the import and the same code runs on your machines. `jul serve`
  speaks the Jev HTTP protocol for other languages.

## Quickstart

```python
# from typesafe_sdk import TypeSafeClient, Choice, Noul, Score
from jul import TypeSafeClient, Choice, Noul, Score

client = TypeSafeClient()                             # wemm-4b-4bit, or model="minicpm5-2b"

response = client.system_one(
    state={"ticket": "I was charged twice for my subscription this month."},
    questions={
        "team": Choice(instructions="Which team should handle this ticket?",
                       criteria={"billing": "payments, invoices, refunds",
                                 "technical": "bugs, errors, crashes",
                                 "sales": "pricing, plans, demos"}),
        "is_bug": Noul(instructions="Does the message report a software bug?"),
        "frustration": Score(instructions="How frustrated is the customer?",
                             criteria=["Calm", "Frustrated but civil", "Very angry"]),
    },
)

response.choices["team"].choice           # "billing"
response.choices["team"].probabilities    # {"billing": 0.88, "technical": 0.11, "sales": 0.01}
response.nouls["is_bug"].noul             # 0.12
response.scores["frustration"].score      # 1.15
```

The model compares your text with each option's *description*, so write descriptions a colleague
would understand; the key is only the name you get back. `noul` is the probability of yes, and `score`
is the expected level on your scale, from 0 ("Calm") to 2 ("Very angry"). `AsyncTypeSafeClient` has the same API.
Arguments that only make sense for a remote API (`api_key`, `retry`, …) are accepted and ignored, so
code written for Jev runs unchanged.
From the shell, use `jul ask`. Non-Python callers can use `jul serve`, which speaks the Jev HTTP
protocol ([docs/serve.md](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/docs/serve.md)).

## Install

```bash
pip install jul
jul setup          # picks MLX or PyTorch, installs it, downloads the default model, runs one decision
```

Python ≥ 3.10. The default model weighs 2.6 GB and is downloaded once from the Hugging Face Hub.
To pick the backend yourself (`jul[mlx]`, `jul[torch]`, `jul[onnx]`), see
[docs/installation.md](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/docs/installation.md).

## How it works

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usejul/jul/d1f0d236aed437d57b625d36c3841f2d156ee637/docs/assets/how-it-works-dark.svg">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usejul/jul/d1f0d236aed437d57b625d36c3841f2d156ee637/docs/assets/how-it-works.svg" alt="The text and the option descriptions go through the same model; the answer is the closest option vector" width="760">
</picture>

JuL reads the hidden state the model built for your text and compares it with the vectors of your
option descriptions. Your task never reaches the weights, so you can change the options between two calls, or swap the model, without retraining
anything. When it is off on your data, `client.autotune(...)` fits a small head on labeled examples
and keeps it only if it beats zero-shot in cross-validation
([docs/tuning.md](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/docs/tuning.md)).

## Results

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usejul/jul/d1f0d236aed437d57b625d36c3841f2d156ee637/docs/assets/results.svg" alt="Mean accuracy on Jev's benchmark per model" width="760">
</picture>

Jev's published benchmark, 300 examples, zero-shot for every JuL model, run with
`scripts/bench_jul.py`. Each mean is ±3 points. Banking77 and Emotion are in MTEB, which the
`wemm-*` and `f2llm-*` models trained on, so AG News is the clean comparison: 0.95 for `wemm-4b`,
0.91 for Jev, and 0.90 for the default model. The default model's ECE is 0.084 against Jev's 0.156, which is what lets you automate
above a confidence threshold. Every setting was fitted on English, and we haven't tested domains far
from this kind of text (sensor logs, chemistry and so on). Per-task scores, the 18 models measured and
the tuned results are in
[docs/benchmarks.md](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/docs/benchmarks.md).

### The baseline worth remembering

A TF-IDF + linear SVM, trained on 1000 labeled examples with no LLM at all, scores 0.88 on AG News,
0.76 on Banking77 and 0.43 on Emotion: a mean of 0.690 at 0.17 ms per prediction
(`scripts/bench_tfidf.py`). It is 11 points behind the default model on Banking77 and far behind on
Emotion, where telling feelings apart takes meaning, not vocabulary. If you have labels and your problem is
sorting by topic or intent, try it first. CI re-measures these numbers on every PR
([numbers.yml](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/.github/workflows/numbers.yml), `CLAIMED`),
so update both together.

## Models

| Preset | Size | Jev bench, zero-shot | + autotune, 1000 labels | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `wemm-4b-4bit` (default, alias `accurate`) | 2.6 GB | 0.857 | 0.897 | built in |
| `minicpm5-2b` (alias `fast`) | 2.7 GB | 0.617 | 0.757 | built in, 64 ms on an M4 Pro |
| `minicpm5-2b-decision` | 1.3 GB | see [benchmarks](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/docs/benchmarks.md) | — | trained decision model, `jul models add` |
| `e5-small` (ONNX, 8-bit) | 0.09 GB | 0.543 | 0.713 (0.790 hybrid head) | encoder, 6 ms per text on an M4 Pro; needs an ONNX export first, see [models](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/docs/models.md#micro-models-encoders) |
| `jul-decision-wemm-4b-4bit` (MLX, 4-bit) | 2.6 GB (+0.07 GB adapters) | 0.857 ¹ | 0.897 ¹ | the default model with a [LoRA cross model](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/docs/models.md#a-cross-model-on-the-presets-own-weights-lora) on the same weights for Noul and Score (yes/no 0.841 on Kev's typed decisions, against 0.762 with vectors; ~115 ms per yes/no on an M4 Pro); one model in memory, `jul models add` |
| `jul-decision-e5-small` (ONNX, 8-bit) | 0.09 GB (+0.09 GB cross model) | 0.557 | 0.723 (0.780 hybrid head) | e5-small trained on jul decisions, with a [cross model](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/docs/models.md#cross-models-reading-the-question-and-the-text-together) for Noul and Score (yes/no 0.726 on Kev's typed decisions, against 0.579 with vectors); runs in [AWS Lambda](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/docs/aws-lambda.md), `jul models add` |

¹ Choice questions, the only ones in the Jev benchmark, are read by the vectors of `wemm-4b-4bit`, which the
adapters leave untouched (switched off, the features are the same): its numbers.

To use another model, run `jul models add <name> --repo <hf-repo>`. It fits the layer, center and
temperature on the dev sets. The 18 models we measured, encoders, decision models and every setting
are listed in [docs/models.md](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/docs/models.md).

## Decisions inside an AWS Lambda

`jul-decision-e5-small` runs inside an AWS Lambda function, model included in the package: 17 ms per
message and $0.59 per million at 1,769 MB, a 2.4 s cold start, no GPU and no server. Jev is a hosted
API and CLM-8B needs a GPU server; to our knowledge no other typed-decision library puts its model in a
Lambda. It is not a general-purpose endpoint: it is a small model embedded in a function that decides
one precise thing on every event, with the questions fixed at build time, and it should be tuned on
labeled examples of that thing (`autotune`: 0.557 zero-shot, 0.780 tuned on the Jev bench). `jul pack`
ships only the model(s) the questions need. Step by step, with the AWS CLI or CDK:
[docs/aws-lambda.md](https://github.com/usejul/jul/blob/main/docs/aws-lambda.md).
